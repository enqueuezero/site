# Scalability

## Context

Scaling is a fundamental requirement for a system running over one node.

The scalability of a system measures how well the system can scale itself for increasing loads.

## Overview

There are two ways of scaling.

* Vertical scaling, or scaling up, by using more powerful machines with faster CPU, higher memory, and larger disk space.
* Horizontal scaling, or scaling out, by adding more machines into a cluster. The performance of the cluster is the summary of all machines and the network in-between.

## Patterns

## Conclusions

Moore's law has reached the end, meaning the limit of vertical scaling is out there.
As a result, if you want your system continuously grow, do horizontal scale!
