[Homomorphic hashing for secure update propagation - Facebook Code](https://code.fb.com/security/homomorphic-hashing/)

**Homomorphic hashing** is a cryptographic primitive that can efficient make file distribution and memory integrity checking. **LtHash** is a specific homomorphic hashing algorithm, within the update propagation step of the *Location Aware Distribution* configuration management system.

The challenge of securing update propagation at scale is **handling frequent updates with a centralized distributor can saturate the system**. 

The solution is to **to delegate the propagation through its clients**, meaning some subscribers can participate in forwarding the distributor’s original updates to other subscribers.

From an implementation perspective, it requires **Signing each update**, **Signing the database**, and **Efficiently updatable hashing**.

Intuitively, homomorphic hashing answers the question, “Given the hash of an input, along with a small update to that input, how can we compute the hash of the new input (with the update applied) without having to recompute the entire hash from scratch?”

[Using Go Modules - The Go Blog](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules)

- `go mod init` creates a new module, initializing the `go.mod` file that describes it.
- `go build`, `go test`, and other package-building commands add new dependencies to `go.mod` as needed.
- `go list -m all` prints the current module’s dependencies.
- `go get` changes the required version of a dependency (or adds a new dependency).
- `go mod tidy` removes unused dependencies.

[Computer Latency at a Human Scale](https://www.prowesscorp.com/computer-latency-at-a-human-scale/)

If say 1 CPU cycle took 1 second, then an Internet call across Pacific Ocean would take 11 years!

Therefore, we must keep **latency** in mind! When making a microservices call or getting cloud-based data, the application takes more time comparing to the slowest calls to storage. Optimizing your code to work in memory could be a wasted effort.

[Inside Kubernetes RBAC](https://medium.com/@dominik.tornow/inside-kubernetes-rbac-9988b08a738a)

This post provides a concise, detailed model of Kubernetes’ Role-based Access Control (RBAC). The Kubernetes API is an Http API that provides Create/Read/Update/Delete access to query and modify the Kubernetes Object Store. Kubernetes supports multiple authentication and authorization strategies to control the access to the API.

**General authorization** indicates a relation *hasAccess* between a requesting user and a requested operation. Role-based authorization can be modeled as two relations, a relation matches between a role and a user and a relation grants between a role and an operation.

Kubernetes provides 4 Kubernetes Object Kinds to express Role-based Authorization, *Roles* and *Cluster Roles* as well as *Role Bindings* and *Cluster Role Bindings*.

[Application-level Stackless features - PyPy documentation](https://pypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stackless.html)

Currently PyPy implements greenlets on top of continulets. It also implements (an approximation of) tasklets and channels, emulating the model of Stackless Python.

Continulets are extremely light-weight, thought it consumes at least one page of physical memory (4KB) per live continulet, and half a megabyte of virtual memory on 32-bit or a complete megabyte on 64-bit.

The fundamental idea is that, at any point in time, the program happens to run one stack of frames (or one per thread, in case of multi-threading).
