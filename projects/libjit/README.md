# Jit Uncover

*Jit Uncover* is a series of hands-on articles teaching you how to implement a JIT compiler plus a new programming language "Julang" (Jit Uncover Language). We will explore JIT through [Libjit](https://www.gnu.org/software/libjit/), a GNU library that provides generic Just-In-Time compiler functionality independent of any particular bytecode, language, or runtime. Comparing to LLVM, libjit is very tiny but gives you all the essential knowledge of JIT, while not let you distracted by all the other stuff.
